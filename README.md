Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications. Simply put, it's a compilation of rules and conventions on organizing code. The main purpose of this methodology is to make the project more understandable and structured in the face of ever-changing business requirements.

This methodology is not tied to a particular stack â€” it can be used for web or native applications.

Advantages
Uniformity
The code is organized by scope of influence (layers), by domain (slices), and by technical purpose (segments).
This creates a standardized architecture that is easy to comprehend for newcomers.

Controlled reuse of logic
Each architectural component has its purpose and predictable dependencies.
This keeps a balance between following the DRY principle and adaptation possibilities.

Stability in face of changes and refactoring
A module on a particular layer cannot use other modules on the same layer, or the layers above.
This enables isolated modifications without unforeseen consequences.

Orientation to business and users needs
When the app is split into business domains, you can navigate the code to discover and deeper understand all the project features.
